# Comprehensive OCR System for Telugu Language
## The Banti Framework

This framework relies on the ability of a segmentation algorithm to break the
text in to glyphs. Hence it can be extended to other scripts with well 
seperated images like Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, Kannada, Thai etc.

# Features
+ Opens box files generated by antanci_segmenter
+ Passes them to a neural network trained by [theanet](https://github.com/rakeshvar/theanet)
+ n-gram modelling of the language
+ Ability to stich broken glyphs (using the language model).

# Dependencies
1. Python3
1. Numpy, Scipy, Nose etc.
1. [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano)
1. Pillow
1. [Theanet](https://github.com/rakeshvar/theanet)

# Installation Instructions

1. Use python3

  You should already have it. Just type `which python3` and  check. You will also be using `pip3`. Python3.4 comes with `pip3`. Python3.3 and older need additional installation of `pip3`. We recommend you upgrade to `python3.4`

2. Install `Theano` after installing its dependencies. Here are the [General](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html) and  the 
[Ubuntu-specific](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install_ubuntu.html#install-ubuntu) instructions. But they are given for `python2.7`. For `python3.4` you will need to put at `3` in a few places. like this...
  ```
  sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-dev python3-pip python3-nose g++ libopenblas-dev git
  sudo pip install Theano
  ```

3. Install [Theanet](https://github.com/rakeshvar/theanet) by running `python3 setup.py`.

4. Clone this repo. ([banti_telugu_ocr](https://github.com/TeluguOCR/banti_telugu_ocr))

5. Set the following theano flag(s). I just put the following in my .bashrc file.
        ```sh
        export THEANO_FLAGS='floatX=float32'
        ```

7. Run the ocr program 
        ```sh
        python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.box 
        # Run for help
        python3 recognize.py -h
        ```
  Here you are running on the provided sample image `praasa.box` genereated from `praasa.tif` (both in the `sample_images` directory)

8. OCRing your own images.
  ```sh
  python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.tif
  python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.jpg
  python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.png
  ```
