# Comprehensive OCR System for Telugu Language
## The Banti Framework

This framework relies on the ability of a segmentation algorithm to break the
text in to glyphs. Hence it can be extended to other scripts with well 
seperated images like Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, Kannada, Thai etc.

# Features
+ Opens box files generated by antanci_segmenter
+ Passes them to a neural network trained by [theanet](https://github.com/rakeshvar/theanet)
+ n-gram modelling of the language
+ Ability to stich broken glyphs (using the language model).

# Dependencies
1. Python3
1. Numpy, Scipy, Nose etc.
1. [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano)
1. Pillow
1. [Theanet](https://github.com/rakeshvar/theanet)

# Installation Instructions

1. Install python3

  You might already have it. Just type ```which python3``` and  check. Make sure you also have ```pip3```. Python3.4 comes with ```pip3```. Python3.3 and older need additional installation of ```pip3```.

2. Install ```Theano``` after installing its dependencies. Here are the [General](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html) and  the 
[Ubuntu-specific](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install_ubuntu.html#install-ubuntu) instructions. You just need to install numpy, scipy, nose etc.

3. Install [Theanet](https://github.com/rakeshvar/theanet) by running the setup.py

4. Clone this repo. ([banti_telugu_ocr](https://github.com/TeluguOCR/banti_telugu_ocr))

5. Set the following theano flag(s). I just put the following in my .bashrc file.
  ```sh
  export THEANO_FLAGS='floatX=float32'
  ```
7. Run the ocr program 
  ```sh
  python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.box 
  # Run for help
  python3 recognize.py -h
  ```
  Here you are running on the provided sample image ```praasa.box``` genereated from ```praasa.tif``` (both in the ```sample_images``` directory)

8. OCRing your own images.
  ```sh
  python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.tif
  python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.jpg
  python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.png
  ```
