# Comprehensive OCR System for Telugu Language
## The Banti Framework

This framework relies on the ability of a segmentation algorithm to break the
text in to glyphs. Hence it can be extended to other scripts with well 
seperated images like Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil, Kannada, Thai etc.

# Features
+ Opens box files generated by antanci_segmenter
+ Passes them to a neural network trained by [theanet](https://github.com/rakeshvar/theanet)
+ n-gram modelling of the language
+ Ability to stich broken glyphs (using the language model).

# Dependencies
1. Python3
1. Numpy, Scipy, Nose etc.
1. [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano)
1. Pillow
1. [Theanet](https://github.com/rakeshvar/theanet)

# Installation Instructions

### Notes
1. These instructions are tailored to Ubuntu. You should make changes based on your OS.
2. Use python3. You should already have it. Just type `which python3` and  check. You will also be using `pip3`. Python3.4 comes with `pip3`. Python3.3 and older need additional installation of `pip3`. We recommend you upgrade to Python3.4.

### Dependencies
1. Install Theano after its dependencies. [General](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html) and [Ubuntu-specific](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install_ubuntu.html#install-ubuntu) instructions. But they are given for `python2.7`. For `python3.4` you will need to put at `3` in a few places. like such...
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-dev python3-pip python3-nose 
  sudo apt-get install g++ libopenblas-dev git
  sudo pip3 install --upgrade --no-deps git+git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
  ```

2. Install [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.org) as
  ```sh
  sudo pip3 install Pillow
  ```

3. Install [Theanet](https://github.com/rakeshvar/theanet) as 
  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:rakeshvar/theanet.git
  cd theanet
  sudo python3 setup.py install 
  ```

4. Clone this repo. ([banti_telugu_ocr](https://github.com/TeluguOCR/banti_telugu_ocr))
  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:TeluguOCR/banti_telugu_ocr.git
  cd banti_telugu_ocr
  ```

5. Set the following theano flag(s). (I just put the following in my .bashrc file.)
  ```sh
  export THEANO_FLAGS='floatX=float32'
  ```

7. Run the ocr program as
  ```sh
  python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.tif
  ```
  You will find the output in `sample_images/praasa.ml.txt, praasa.nogram.txt, praasa.gram.txt`. Pick the one that works best for you.
  
  You can also use other image formats as
  ```sh
  python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.jpg
  ```
  To see full options and get help run
  ```sh
  python3 recognize.py -h
  ```
  This program can also perform OCR on a `box` file generated by [antanci_ocr](https://github.com/TeluguOCR/antanci_ocr) system.
   ```sh
  python3 recognize.py sample_images/praasa.box 
  ```
  
  Here you are running on the provided sample image `praasa.box` genereated from `praasa.tif` (both in the `sample_images` directory)
